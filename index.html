        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <pre>
            My name is Ali. I am a CST student at BCIT. This is my first time doing programing.
            While I'm fully aware of how diffecalt this program is (or at least I hope I do),
            I look forward to learning new knowledge and makeing new friends.

        <h3>Program Courses</h3>
        
        <ul>


            <li style="background-color:yellow;"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comm1116"><b>Business Communications 1 (COMM 1116)</b>
                <p>Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with their supervisors,<br>
                colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly,<br>
                and effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional and efficient communicator at work. You will write<br>
                effective business correspondence and instructions and deliver a formal oral presentation to your set. The first term<br>
                establishes the principles and basic patterns on which you will build more advanced applications in the second term.</p></a></li>
                    
            
            <li style="background-color:lightblue;"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1100"><b>CST Program Fundamentals (COMP 1100)</b>
                <p>The course covers topics of importance to new and continuing students on how to balance school and related activities<br>
                to enhance chances of success in their academic careers. In this course students will learn a variety of different techniques<br>
                to improve study habits, note taking, and time management skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST<br>
                students and will introduce students to various support systems at BCIT.</p></a></li>
            

            <li style="background-color:lemonchiffon;"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1113"><b>Applied Mathematics (COMP 1113)</b>
                <p>Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this course is<br>
                to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three parts:<br>
                (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits<br>
                (2) number systems and data representation and<br>
                (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.</p></a></li>


            <li style="background-color:blueviolet;"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1510"><b>Programming Methods (COMP 1510)</b>
                <p>This hands-on course is the foundation for all future programming courses and complements COMP 1536 and COMP 1910.<br>
                This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming including design, development, testing, debugging simple<br>
                programs, as well as error-handling, and problem solving.</p></a></li>


            <li style="background-color: chartreuse"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1536"><b>Introduction to Web Development (COMP 1536)</b>
                <p>This course is a web design and programming course with an emphasis on good planning, interface design, multimedia,<br>
                client-side scripting with JavaScript, server-side scripting, and best practices. COMP 1536 will provide students with<br>
                a solid understanding about how web applications are constructed and deployed. Students will be taught to use client-side RAD tools<br>
                in order to enhance their productivity. Students will complete a number of assignments and exams as well as one larger project.</p></a></li>


            <li style="background-color: lightcoral"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1712"><b>Business Analysis and System Design (COMP 1712)</b>
                <p>Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and<br>
                develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document<br>
                communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to<br>
                the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover<br>
                requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements, traditional<br>
                approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an introduction to relational database normalization.<br>
                Agile life cycles such as Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as waterfall. By the end of<br>
                this course, successful participants will be able to use tools and methods commonly used in industry to analyze, design, and implement<br>
                information systems as confirmed by a term project.</p></a></li>


            <li style="background-color: lightseagreen"><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/outlines/comp1930"><b>Projects 1 (COMP 1930)</b>
                <p>Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale software project: a web app. Design and managing<br>
                of implementation concepts will be introduced: User Experience Design (XSD) and Agile methodology. The course takes students through<br>
                the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews, creating personas and user stories, designing<br>
                wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is based on the UX design process. Students will use<br>
                the Agile methodology to manage the software process. Software management workflow also includes using version control, version control<br>
                basics, utilizing web technologies (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, data persistence via NoSQL data technologies). Some of the JavaScript topics<br>
                include DOM manipulation, event handling, web storage, AJAX calls and using JQuery in order to create a rich web app.</p></a></li>
